## 📜 How It Works

### Weather Generation:
The system generates weather based on **seasonal** and **location-based** logic. Each region of your map could experience different weather conditions. 🌍 From sunny days in the desert to frequent storms along the coastline, the system is designed to reflect natural climate patterns.

### Weather Effects:
Each weather type (rain, snow, fog, etc.) triggers **unique effects**:
- **Floods** during heavy rain 🌧️
- **Power outages** during storms ⚡
- **Blizzards** that slow movement and visibility ❄️

### Forecast System:
The **5-day forecast** is available for players to check and plan for the future, ensuring they’re always prepared for changing conditions. 📅

### Farming Integration:
- **Temperature and humidity** affect crop growth, making farming more realistic and strategic. 🌾
- **Crops grow faster** in perfect conditions and **slower** in unfavorable weather, requiring players to adapt to the changing climate.
